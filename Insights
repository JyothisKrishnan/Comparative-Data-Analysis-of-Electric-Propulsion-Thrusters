Resistojets lead in efficiency (~40%) but produce low thrust (~500 mN), making them ideal for small, fuel-efficient maneuvers like satellite station-keeping. In contrast, MPDT/ECR thrusters deliver the highest thrust (~3,000 mN) but at a lower efficiency (~20%), better suited for high-power missions like interplanetary travel. This trade-off highlights the need to match thruster type to mission requirements
