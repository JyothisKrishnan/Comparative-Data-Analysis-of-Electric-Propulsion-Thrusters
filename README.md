# Comparative-Data-Analysis-of-Electric-Propulsion-Thrusters
# Overview
This project aims to perform a comprehensive comparison of six electric propulsion thrusters for space applications. By analyzing and visualizing key performance metrics, the project provides insights into the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of different thruster technologies, aiding in their selection for mission-specific requirements.

# Problem Statement
The selection of an appropriate electric propulsion thruster for a specific space mission is complicated by varying performance metrics. This project addresses the gap in existing studies by comparing multiple thruster technologies under standardized metrics and providing mission-specific recommendations.

# Objectives
1. Collect performance data of six electric propulsion thrusters.
2. Compare thrusters using both maximum and average metric values.
3. Visualize trade-offs between key metrics using graphs and charts.
4. Provide recommendations for thruster selection based on mission profiles.
